    "To tackle this assignment, you'll need to implement the following steps in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Investment Data:**\n",
    "   - Create a function `loadInvestments(investmentFilename)` that reads the CSV file and extracts the investment name, cost, and estimated return on investment. The estimated return is calculated as `zhvi * 10year`, where `zhvi` is the home price and `10year` is the ratio for the return.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**\n",
    "   - Implement the `optimizeInvestments(investments, budget)` function using dynamic programming. This function will create a 2D table where rows represent different investment options and columns represent the budget from 0 up to the maximum amount of money you have to invest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traceback for Optimal Investment Selection:**\n",
    "   - After filling the DP table, use a traceback process to determine which investments were selected to achieve the optimal return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic outline for the `portfolio.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "def loadInvestments(investmentFilename):\n",
    "    investments = []\n",
    "    with open(investmentFilename, 'r') as file:\n",
    "        reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n",
    "        for row in reader:\n",
    "            if row['RegionName'] != 'United States':\n",
    "                name = row['RegionName']\n",
    "                cost = int(row['ZHVI'])\n",
    "                return_on_investment = int(float(row['10year']) * cost * 100)\n",
    "                investments.append((name, cost, return_on_investment))\n",
    "    return investments\n",
    "\n",
    "def optimizeInvestments(investments, budget):\n",
    "    n = len(investments)\n",
    "    dp = [[0] * (budget + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n",
    "        name, cost, roi = investments[i - 1]\n",
    "        for j in range(1, budget + 1):\n",
    "            if cost <= j:\n",
    "                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - cost] + roi)\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Traceback to find the selected investments\n",
    "    selected_investments = []\n",
    "    i, j = n, budget\n",
    "    while i > 0 and j > 0:\n",
    "        if dp[i][j] != dp[i - 1][j]:\n",
    "            name, cost, roi = investments[i - 1]\n",
    "            selected_investments.append(name)\n",
    "            j -= cost\n",
    "        i -= 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return dp[-1][-1], selected_investments[::-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    investments = loadInvestments('zhvi-short.csv')\n",
    "    budget = 15\n",
    "    optimal_roi, selected_investments = optimizeInvestments(investments, budget)\n",
    "    print(f\"Optimal ROI: {optimal_roi}\")\n",
    "    print(\"Selected Investments:\", selected_investments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Works:\n",
    "1. **`loadInvestments` Function:**\n",
    "   - Reads and parses the CSV file, ignoring the first two rows and starting from the third row (California onwards).\n",
    "   - It calculates the `EstimatedReturnOnInvestment` as the product of `zhvi` and `10year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`optimizeInvestments` Function:**\n",
    "   - Initializes a DP table with rows representing each investment and columns representing every possible budget value from 0 to the given budget.\n",
    "   - Fills the table by considering whether to include or exclude each investment.\n",
    "   - After the table is filled, it traces back from the bottom-right corner to determine which investments were chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing:**\n",
    "   - With a test file like `zhvi-short.csv` and a budget of $15, the code should select Illinois and California to maximize the return on investment.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`loadInvestments` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To load and parse the investment data from the given CSV file.\n",
    "   - **Logic:** It skips the first two rows (header and United States row) and then reads each subsequent row. The `EstimatedReturnOnInvestment` is calculated by multiplying the `ZHVI` (home price) by `10year` and converting it into a dollar amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`optimizeInvestments` Function:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To determine the optimal investment strategy using dynamic programming.\n",
    "   - **Logic:** It creates a 2D DP table where each cell `[i][j]` contains the maximum ROI possible using the first `i` investments with a budget of `j`. The function also includes a traceback mechanism to determine which investments were included in the optimal strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Block:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To execute the program with the provided test file `zhvi-short.csv` and a budget of $15.\n",
    "   - **Logic:** It loads the investments, calculates the optimal ROI, and prints the optimal return along with the selected investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "When you run the script, it will print the optimal return on investment and the list of selected investments that yield this return.\n",
