    "### Small World Phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "The small world phenomenon refers to the observation that in social networks, individuals are typically connected by short paths of acquaintanceship or friendship. This means that even in large networks, most pairs of people can be connected through a relatively small number of intermediate connections. The concept gained prominence through Stanley Milgram's famous \"six degrees of separation\" experiment, which suggested that any two people in the world are connected by at most six acquaintances. This phenomenon has since been studied in various contexts, including social networks, the internet, and even biological networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the small world phenomenon:\n",
    "- Small average path length: Check if the average distance between nodes is relatively low,\n",
    "    suggesting short paths exist between nodes.\n",
    "- High clustering coefficient: Evaluate if nodes tend to cluster together, indicating \n",
    "    local connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations based on distance distribution:\n",
    "- Distance 1: 1.08% - Very low percentage, suggesting very few direct connections (possibly hubs or central nodes).\n",
    "- Distance 2: 16.65% - Moderate percentage, indicating a significant number of nodes are reachable within 2 steps.\n",
    "- Distance 3: 24.41% - Another significant percentage, showing nodes are generally reachable within 3 steps.\n",
    "- Higher distances (4 and beyond): Gradually decreasing percentages, indicating fewer long-distance connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "- The network exhibits characteristics of the small world phenomenon with a notable portion of nodes being reachable within 2 to 3 steps.\n",
    "    - Nearly 98% of people are connected by at most 6 aquaintances\n",
    "    - Nearly 42% of people are connected by at most 3 aquaitances\n",
    "- However, the very low percentage of distance 1 connections suggests some nodes may act as hubs or central points of connectivity.\n",
    "- Further analysis of average path length and clustering coefficient would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the network's structure and small world properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since nearly 98% of social connections between people can be done through 6 or less aquaitances, the network given in 'edges.txt' strongly statisfied the small world phenomenon."

    "Yes, you have the right understanding of the process. Here is a more detailed breakdown of each step:\n",

    "1. **Calculate the Existing Distribution (via BFS) of Distance Counts**:\n",
    "   - Perform BFS for each vertex in the graph to calculate the distances between all pairs of vertices.\n",
    "   - Store these distances in a data structure, such as a dictionary, where the keys are the distances and the values are the counts of how many vertex pairs have that distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Store the Counts of the Distances**:\n",
    "   - Maintain a distribution dictionary that keeps track of the counts of each distance. This will help you avoid recalculating distances for the entire graph when adding a new vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add New Vertex with New Edge Data/Nodes**:\n",
    "   - Introduce the new vertex to the graph and connect it with its neighbors by updating the adjacency list.\n",
    "   - This step modifies the graph structure to include the new vertex and its edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Distance Distribution via BFS for That New Vertex Only**:\n",
    "   - Run BFS starting from the new vertex to determine its distances to all other vertices in the graph.\n",
    "   - This BFS will reveal how the new vertex changes the distance distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Append the Distance Counts to the Appropriate Distances of the Original, Stored Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Update the original distribution with the distances computed from the new vertex.\n",
