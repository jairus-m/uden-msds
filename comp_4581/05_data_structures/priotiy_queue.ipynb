    "### Overview of Priority Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue is a data structure where each element has a priority associated with it. Elements are served based on their priority, with higher priority elements being dequeued before lower priority ones. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue (this can vary depending on the implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "data structure: binary heap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Priority-Based**: Elements are ordered by priority.\n",
    "2. **Efficient Access**: The highest (or lowest) priority element can be accessed efficiently.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic**: Priorities can be dynamic, allowing for elements to be added with varying priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Operations:\n",
    "1. **Insert**: Add an element with a specific priority.\n",
    "2. **Extract-Max/Min**: Remove and return the element with the highest or lowest priority.\n",
    "3. **Peek/Top**: Return the element with the highest or lowest priority without removing it.\n",
    "4. **Change Priority**: Change the priority of an element (supported in some implementations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of Priority Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority queues can be implemented in several ways, but the most common implementations use heaps due to their efficient operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using a Binary Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap property:\n",
    "- **Max-Heap**: The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children.\n",
    "- **Min-Heap**: The key at each node is less than or equal to the keys of its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Max-Heap Example (Python Implementation):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import heapq\n",
    "\n",
    "class MaxHeap:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.heap = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    def push(self, item):\n",
    "        heapq.heappush(self.heap, -item)  # Use negative values to simulate a max-heap\n",
    "\n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        return -heapq.heappop(self.heap)  # Return the negated value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def peek(self):\n",
    "        return -self.heap[0]  # Return the negated value of the root\n",

    "print(max_heap.pop())   # Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Min-Heap Example (Python Implementation):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "print(min_heap.pop())   # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Search Tree**: Can be used to implement a priority queue, providing efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. However, it may not be as efficient as a heap for the extract-min/max operations.\n",
    "2. **Unordered List**: Simple to implement but inefficient, with O(n) time complexity for extracting the min/max.\n",
    "3. **Ordered List**: More efficient than an unordered list for extraction but still less efficient than a heap, with O(n) time complexity for insertion to maintain order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Priority Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scheduling**: Operating systems use priority queues to schedule processes based on priority.\n",
    "2. **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and Prim's minimum spanning tree use priority queues.\n",
    "3. **Event Simulation**: Managing events in simulations, where events are processed in order of their scheduled times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority queues are versatile and can be adapted to a variety of problems requiring efficient priority management. The choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements for efficiency in insertion, deletion, and access operations."

    "### Types of Binary Heaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Min-Heap**:\n",
    "   - In a min-heap, for every node `i` other than the root, `heap[parent(i)] <= heap[i]`. This means the smallest element is at the root, and for any node, its parent has a smaller or equal value.\n",
    "   - Operations are such that the root is the minimum element in the heap, making it optimal for implementing priority queues where the minimum element needs quick access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Max-Heap**:\n",
    "   - In a max-heap, for every node `i` other than the root, `heap[parent(i)] >= heap[i]`. This places the largest element at the root, and each parent node has a greater or equal value than its children.\n",

    "   \n",
    "2. **Heapify-Up Operation**: \n",
    "   - Compare the newly added element with its parent.\n",
    "   - If the element violates the heap property (for a min-heap: parent > child), swap the element with its parent.\n",

    "1. **Build a Heap**: Convert the input array into a heap structure.\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heap Insertion**: Adds an element while maintaining the heap property by comparing and potentially swapping it with its parent (heapify-up).\n",
