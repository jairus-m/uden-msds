    "A queue and a stack are both linear data structures used to store collections of elements. However, they have different rules for adding and removing elements. Here are the key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Order of Operations**: A queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.\n",
    "2. **Operations**: \n",
    "   - **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end (rear) of the queue.\n",
    "   - **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.\n",
    "3. **Use Cases**: Queues are commonly used in scenarios where order needs to be preserved, such as scheduling tasks, handling requests in web servers, and breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.\n",
    "4. **Real-Life Analogy**: A queue is like a line of people waiting to buy tickets. The first person in line is the first to get a ticket and leave the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Order of Operations**: A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.\n",
    "2. **Operations**: \n",
    "   - **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "   - **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.\n",
    "3. **Use Cases**: Stacks are commonly used in scenarios where the most recent element needs to be accessed first, such as in function call management, undo mechanisms in text editors, and depth-first search (DFS) in graphs.\n",
    "4. **Real-Life Analogy**: A stack is like a stack of plates. The last plate placed on the stack is the first one to be taken off.\n",

    "A deque (doubly-ended queue) and a list are both versatile data structures in Python, but they serve different purposes and have different performance characteristics. Here’s a comparison to help you decide when to use each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deque\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "1. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - **Append and Pop**: O(1) time complexity for operations at both ends.\n",
    "   - **Insert and Delete**: Efficient at both ends.\n",
    "2. **Thread-Safe**: Deque operations are thread-safe for append and pop operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "1. **Queue and Stack**: Ideal for implementing queues (FIFO) and stacks (LIFO) due to O(1) performance for append and pop operations at both ends.\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window**: Useful for algorithms that require a sliding window, such as in certain dynamic programming problems or finding maximum/minimum elements in a window.\n",
    "3. **Deque-based Algorithms**: Suitable for problems that inherently require operations at both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "d = deque()\n",
    "d.append(1)       # Add to the rear\n",

    "d.popleft()       # Remove from the front\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "1. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - **Append**: O(1) average time complexity for appending to the end.\n",
    "   - **Pop**: O(1) time complexity for popping from the end, O(n) from the front.\n",
    "   - **Insert**: O(n) time complexity for inserting elements, especially in the middle or front.\n",
    "   - **Delete**: O(n) time complexity for deleting elements, especially in the middle or front.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: More flexible for operations involving random access or modifications at arbitrary positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "1. **Random Access**: When you need to access elements by index frequently, as lists provide O(1) time complexity for index-based access.\n",
    "2. **In-place Modifications**: When you need to modify elements at arbitrary positions.\n",
    "3. **Static Data**: Suitable for scenarios where the data doesn’t change frequently, or changes are mostly append operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l = []\n",
    "l.append(1)     # Add to the end\n",
    "l.insert(0, 2)  # Insert at the front (O(n) operation)\n",
    "l.pop()         # Remove from the end\n",
    "l.pop(0)        # Remove from the front (O(n) operation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Either\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use a Deque** when:\n",
    "  - You need efficient append and pop operations at both ends of the sequence.\n",
    "  - You are implementing a queue or stack.\n",
    "  - Your algorithm requires frequent additions and removals from both ends.\n",
    "  - You need a thread-safe data structure for appending and popping elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use a List** when:\n",
    "  - You need random access to elements (i.e., accessing elements by index).\n",
    "  - Your operations are mostly appending to the end and occasional random access or modifications.\n",
    "  - You need to store and manipulate a sequence of elements where modifications are infrequent or mostly at the end.\n",
    "  - You need the versatility and flexibility of Python lists for slicing, comprehensions, and other list operations.\n",
