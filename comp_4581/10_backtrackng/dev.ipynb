    "The `graphColoring` problem and the `nQueens` problem are both solved using backtracking, but there are key differences in their problem structures and the way feasibility is checked. Here’s a breakdown of how they differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Nature:\n",
    "1. **nQueens**:\n",
    "   - The objective is to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.\n",
    "   - The problem is highly structured around a grid, with specific rules for rows, columns, and diagonals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **graphColoring**:\n",
    "   - The goal is to color the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n",
    "   - The problem is defined by the graph's structure, which can be irregular and does not adhere to a grid format like nQueens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Representation:\n",
    "1. **nQueens**:\n",
    "   - Each state is represented by a list where the index corresponds to the column, and the value at that index corresponds to the row where a queen is placed.\n",
    "   - Example: `[1, 3]` means the first queen is in row 1, column 0, and the second queen is in row 3, column 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **graphColoring**:\n",
    "   - Each state is represented by a list where the index corresponds to the node, and the value at that index corresponds to the color assigned to that node.\n",
    "   - Example: `['r', 'g']` means the first node is colored 'r', and the second node is colored 'g'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feasibility Check:\n",
    "1. **nQueens**:\n",
    "   - Feasibility is checked by ensuring that the queen being placed does not share the same row, column, or diagonal with any previously placed queen.\n",
    "   - The checks involve comparisons with all previously placed queens based on specific geometric rules (row, column, diagonal).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **graphColoring**:\n",
    "   - Feasibility is checked by ensuring that the color assigned to the current node does not match the color of any adjacent node (as defined by the graph’s adjacency matrix).\n",
    "   - The adjacency matrix allows quick determination of whether two nodes are connected, and the check involves comparing the proposed color against the colors of all adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination Condition:\n",
    "1. **nQueens**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm continues until all possible solutions are found, meaning all queens have been placed in all valid configurations.\n",
    "   - Each solution is a complete placement of queens on the board, and it prints each solution when found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **graphColoring**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm stops as soon as the first valid coloring of the graph is found.\n",
    "   - Only one solution is printed, representing a valid coloring where no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example and Output:\n",
    "1. **nQueens**:\n",
    "   - For `n=4`, possible output: `[2, 4, 1, 3]` means queens are placed in positions (2,0), (4,1), (1,2), (3,3).\n",
    "   - There may be multiple valid outputs since multiple configurations can satisfy the non-attacking condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **graphColoring**:\n",
    "   - For a 6-node graph with colors `['r', 'g', 'b']`, possible output: `['r', 'g', 'r', 'b', 'g', 'b']` means nodes A-F are colored in a valid manner.\n",
    "   - Only the first valid coloring is output, with the algorithm terminating immediately after finding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **nQueens**: Focuses on positioning queens on a board with strict geometric constraints, checking rows, columns, and diagonals.\n",
    "- **graphColoring**: Focuses on coloring nodes of a graph with constraints based on adjacency, ensuring no connected nodes share the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "These differences highlight the distinct nature of each problem, despite both being solvable through backtracking and depth-first search strategies."
