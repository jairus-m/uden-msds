    "Let's break down the Python implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, understand each step, and then discuss how to adapt it to Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting vertex (in this case, vertex 0) to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Extracting the Minimum Priority Vertex:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def extractMin(verts): \n",
    "       minIndex = 0 \n",
    "       for v in range(1, len(verts)): \n",
    "           if verts[v][1] < verts[minIndex][1]: \n",
    "               minIndex = v \n",
    "       return verts.pop(minIndex)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** This function selects the vertex with the smallest \"current shortest distance\" from the list `verts`.\n",
    "   - **Process:** It iterates through the list `verts` (which stores vertices and their associated current shortest distances) and finds the vertex with the smallest distance. This vertex is removed from the list and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Initializing the Algorithm:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def shortest(g): \n",
    "       nVerts = len(g) \n",
    "       vertsToProcess = [[i, float(\"inf\")] for i in range(nVerts)] \n",
    "       vertsToProcess[0][1] = 0 \n",
    "       vertsProcessed = []\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Initialize the necessary data structures for the algorithm.\n",
    "   - **`vertsToProcess`:** A list of all vertices in the form `[vertex number, current shortest distance]`. Initially, all distances are set to infinity (`float(\"inf\")`), except the starting vertex (vertex 0), which is set to 0.\n",
    "   - **`vertsProcessed`:** An empty list that will store vertices as they are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Processing Vertices:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while len(vertsToProcess) > 0: \n",
    "       u = extractMin(vertsToProcess) \n",
    "       vertsProcessed.append(u)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Process vertices until all are handled.\n",
    "   - **Extract and Process:** The vertex with the smallest current shortest distance (`u`) is selected using `extractMin` and added to `vertsProcessed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Updating Distances:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for v in vertsToProcess: \n",
    "       if g[u[0]][v[0]] > 0: \n",
    "           if u[1] + g[u[0]][v[0]] < v[1]: \n",
    "               v[1] = u[1] + g[u[0]][v[0]]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Update the shortest distances to adjacent vertices.\n",
    "   - **Check Adjacency:** For each vertex `v` in `vertsToProcess`, if there is an edge between `u` and `v` (`g[u[0]][v[0]] > 0`), calculate the potential new distance from the start vertex to `v` via `u`.\n",
    "   - **Update Distance:** If this new distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update `v`'s distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Output Processed Vertices:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(vertsProcessed)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Output the processed vertices with their shortest distances from the start vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adapting to Prim’s MST Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Prim's algorithm for finding the MST is similar to Dijkstra’s algorithm but focuses on connecting the minimum edge to expand the MST rather than calculating the shortest paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes to Implement Prim's MST Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Instead of storing distances, store the edges that are part of the MST.\n",
    "   - Use a list to track the minimum edge connected to the MST at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Vertices:**\n",
    "   - Like Dijkstra's, extract the minimum edge, but ensure you are selecting the smallest edge connecting the MST to a non-MST vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updating Edges:**\n",
    "   - Update the list of edges with the smallest edge connecting the processed set of vertices to the unprocessed set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prim's MST Python Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    minIndex = 0\n",
    "    for v in range(1, len(edges)):\n",

    "                edgesToProcess.append([u[0], v[0], g[u[0]][v[0]]])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(mstEdges)\n",
    "\n",
