    "1. **printMatrix(m)**: This function prints the matrix `m` row by row.\n",
    "2. **chainMatrix(dims)**: This function computes the minimum cost of multiplying a chain of matrices with dimensions given in the list `dims`.\n",
    "   - **Initialize the table**: `m` is a 2-D list initialized to `None` with dimensions `(n x n)`, where `n` is `len(dims) - 1`.\n",
    "   - **Base case**: The cost of multiplying one matrix is zero, so `m[i][i] = 0` for all `i`.\n",
    "   - **Fill the table**: The function uses a dynamic programming approach to fill the table `m` by diagonals. For each subchain length from 2 to `n`, it calculates the minimum multiplication cost for subchains of that length.\n",
    "   - **Return result**: The minimum cost to multiply the entire chain is stored in `m[0][n-1]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `dims = [30, 35, 15, 5, 10, 20, 25]`\n",
    "- **Output**: The function prints the cost matrix and returns the minimum cost to multiply the matrices, which is `15125` for the given example.\n",

    "3. **Print Statements**: The cost matrix and traceback matrix are printed to help visualize the intermediate steps.\n",
    "4. **`parenStr` Function**: This recursive function constructs the optimal parenthesization string by using the traceback table. If `i == j`, it returns the matrix name `A{i}`.
