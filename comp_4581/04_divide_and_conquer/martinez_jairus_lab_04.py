# Challenge: think about a possible way to implement a DAC method if we had a collection of points on the plane. 
# Can you think of an approach which would work, without adding too much computational complexity? 
# Sometimes we learn by trying, even if we cannot do somethingâ€¦ 

# Brainstorm using DAC?
# 1. Create two 1D arrays - one that is the x-axis and one that contains the y-axis
# 2. Use DAC recursively like normal on the x-axis array to find the closest points 
# 3. Use that minimum x-axis distance to then sort the Y-axis array and then .... ?
# I am not too sure about the best way to use DAC for this problem :(

# Brute Force?
# Calculate each euclidean distance between each point in the plane
# Save the distances in a dict where the key is the pair of points and the value is the distance
# Get the minimum distance
# super not efficient haha
