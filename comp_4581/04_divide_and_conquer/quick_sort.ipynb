    "# Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overview of Quick Sort Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements. It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Pivot**: Select an element from the array to be the pivot. There are various ways to choose the pivot, such as the first element, the last element, the middle element, or a random element.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array such that all elements less than the pivot are on the left side, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right side. The pivot is now in its final sorted position.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Recursively Sort**: Apply the same process recursively to the sub-arrays formed by dividing at the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pseudocode for Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "function QuickSort(arr, low, high):\n",
    "    if low < high:\n",
    "        pivotIndex = Partition(arr, low, high)\n",
    "        QuickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1)\n",
    "        QuickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high)\n",
    "\n",
    "function Partition(arr, low, high):\n",
    "    pivot = arr[high]\n",
    "    i = low - 1\n",
    "    for j = low to high - 1:\n",
    "        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n",
    "            i = i + 1\n",
    "            Swap arr[i] with arr[j]\n",
    "    Swap arr[i + 1] with arr[high]\n",
    "    return i + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Python Implementation with Comments/Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def partition(arr, low, high):\n",
    "    # Choose the last element as the pivot\n",
    "    pivot = arr[high]\n",
    "    # Pointer for the greater element\n",
    "    i = low - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Traverse through all elements\n",
    "    # compare each element with pivot\n",
    "    for j in range(low, high):\n",
    "        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n",
    "            # If element smaller than pivot is found\n",
    "            # swap it with the greater element pointed by i\n",
    "            i = i + 1\n",
    "            # Swapping element at i with element at j\n",
    "            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Swap the pivot element with the greater element specified by i\n",
    "    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Return the position from where partition is done\n",
    "    return i + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "def quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n",
    "    if low < high:\n",
    "        # Find pivot element such that\n",
    "        # element smaller than pivot are on the left\n",
    "        # element greater than pivot are on the right\n",
    "        pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Recursively sort the elements on the left of pivot\n",
    "        quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_index - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Recursively sort the elements on the right of pivot\n",
    "        quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]\n",

    "### 4. Comparison: Quick Sort vs. Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Sort:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Best/Average Case: \\(O(n \\log n)\\)\n",
    "  - Worst Case: \\(O(n^2)\\) (occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(\\log n)\\) due to recursion stack\n",
    "- **In-Place**: Yes\n",
    "- **Stability**: No (equal elements might not preserve their relative order)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Sort:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Best/Average/Worst Case: \\(O(n \\log n)\\)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\) due to temporary arrays\n",
    "- **In-Place**: No (requires extra space for merging)\n",
    "- **Stability**: Yes (equal elements maintain their relative order)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- **Quick Sort** is generally faster in practice due to better cache performance and low constant factors, but it can degrade to \\(O(n^2)\\) in the worst case if not implemented with a good pivot selection strategy (e.g., randomized pivot).\n",
    "- **Merge Sort** guarantees \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time complexity for all cases but requires additional space for temporary arrays, which can be a drawback for large datasets. It is stable and is often used in situations where stability is required or when working with linked lists."

    "Choosing between Quick Sort and Merge Sort depends on several factors, including the characteristics of the data, the specific requirements of the application, and the environment in which the algorithm will run. Here are some guidelines to help you decide when to use each sorting algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Average Case Performance**:\n",
    "   - Quick Sort generally performs better than Merge Sort on average due to its lower constant factors and good cache performance.\n",
    "   - It has an average-case time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\), making it efficient for most practical cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-Place Sorting**:\n",
    "   - Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only \\(O(\\log n)\\) extra space for the recursion stack.\n",
    "   - If memory usage is a concern, Quick Sort is preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Small Arrays**:\n",
    "   - Quick Sort can be faster on small arrays due to its low overhead. Many implementations switch to a simpler sorting algorithm like insertion sort for very small sub-arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Partitionable Data**:\n",
    "   - If the data can be easily partitioned (e.g., random or uniformly distributed data), Quick Sort can be very efficient.\n",
    "   - Avoid using Quick Sort on already sorted or nearly sorted data unless you implement a variant like randomized Quick Sort to avoid the worst-case \\(O(n^2)\\) performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stable Sorting**:\n",
    "   - Merge Sort is stable, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "   - If your application requires stable sorting (e.g., when sorting records by one key while preserving the order of records with equal keys based on another key), Merge Sort is the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistent Performance**:\n",
    "   - Merge Sort guarantees \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time complexity in the worst case, making it more predictable for performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linked Lists**:\n",
    "   - Merge Sort is well-suited for sorting linked lists because it does not require random access to elements.\n",
    "   - It can be implemented without additional space overhead when sorting linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **External Sorting**:\n",
    "   - Merge Sort is used in external sorting algorithms, such as when dealing with large datasets that do not fit into memory.\n",
    "   - It can efficiently merge large sorted chunks of data from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose Quick Sort** if you need an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm and the data is expected to be fairly random. Quick Sort is often the default choice for general-purpose sorting due to its excellent average-case performance and low memory usage.\n",
    "- **Choose Merge Sort** if you need stable sorting, are dealing with linked lists, require consistent worst-case performance, or are performing external sorting with large datasets. Merge Sort's predictable \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time complexity and stability make it suitable for these scenarios."
